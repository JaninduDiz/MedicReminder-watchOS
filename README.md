#### 05. Documentation 

(a) Design Choices
      MedicReminer leverages Apple's native features to provide the best user experience. By integrating the UserNotifications framework, users can seamlessly schedule and manage medication reminders directly within the app. Additionally, we've incorporated efficient data models to track medication details and adherence history, ensuring smooth and reliable management of users' medication schedules.
      
(b) Why would someone want to invest on your project idea
    Medication non-adherence is a widespread issue that can lead to adverse health outcomes. MedicReminder addresses this need by providing a convenient and effective way for individuals to manage their medication schedules. The market for medication reminder apps is growing, driven by an aging population and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. Investing in the project taps into this growing market demand.Application is designed to be scalable, allowing for future enhancements and integrations with other healthcare technologies.

(c) Further enhancements you propose
    Implement cloud synchronization to allow users to access their medication data across multiple devices. Enhance the system to provide more advanced analytics and insights into the relationship between medication adherence and health outcomes by integrate with Apple HealthKit. Additionally, transitioning the app from a standalone application to a comprehensive platform accessible across various Apple devices would enhance user accessibility and convenience, expanding its reach and impact.

(d) How would you commercialize this product
    To commercialize the product, we would adopt a freemium model, offering basic features for free with optional premium subscriptions for advanced functionalities. Additionally, we would explore partnerships with healthcare providers and insurance companies to offer the app as part of wellness programs or patient support services.

#### 06. Reflection

During this part of the assignment, one challenge we encountered was adapting to the differences between coding for iOS and watchOS platforms. While many concepts are similar, there are specific considerations and limitations unique to watchOS development that required careful attention. For instance, navigation items and other user interface elements may behave differently or have different capabilities compared to iOS. Additionally, troubleshooting and finding solutions to issues specific to the watchOS environment were sometimes tricky, as resources and documentation can be more limited compared to iOS development. However, by leveraging my understanding of iOS development and actively seeking out watchOS-specific resources, we were able to overcome these challenges effectively.
